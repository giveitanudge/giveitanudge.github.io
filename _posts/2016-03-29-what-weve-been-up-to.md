Wow it's nuts it's already the end of march, it really doesn't feel like it's been that long. What feels even more nuts though is the amount of work we have released for Nudge in just 3 months!

### Features
- MongoDB <br>
  We have rebuilt our DB structure from the ground up, migrating from PostgreSQL to MongoDB. We will be rolling this out to all our clients over the next few weeks. The biggest improvement is how much faster we can deliver the data to the dashboard, decreasing loading times dramatically! We are really excited about this one and think you will love it too!

- RSS Whitelisting<br>
  You can now add a RSS feed when whitelisting content instead of a single url. Nudge will then automatically add any new content in the feed into the whitelist.
